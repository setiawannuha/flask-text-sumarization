McCarthy fights to lock down a deal in longest speaker contest in 164 years
Kevin McCarthy is locked in a fight for his political future as the California Republican attempts to win the votes he needs to become speaker of the US House of Representatives in what has now become the longest contest in 164 years.
McCarthy suffered a string of defeats on Thursday as the House took round after round of failed votes. The longer the fight drags on, the more dire it becomes for McCarthy as it risks further defections and a loss of confidence in the GOP leader. House Republicans are scheduled to hold a conference call at 10:15 a.m. ET Friday morning, three sources tell CNN.
WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 03: U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) (C) takes his seat as he arrives for the start of the 118th Congress in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol Building on January 03, 2023 in Washington, DC. Today members of the 118th Congress will be sworn-in and the House of Representatives will elect a new Speaker of the House. 
The lack of a new speaker has ground House business to a halt
The House is set to reconvene at noon ET, but it remains to be seen whether Republicans will immediately adjourn or vote for the 12th time on McCarthy’s speaker bid. It’s also unclear whether McCarthy can pick up any new support, something that is viewed among his allies as essential.
Late Thursday, McCarthy said that while there had been progress in negotiations, there was no timeline on when he could get to 218 votes. “If this takes a little longer, that’s OK,” he said.
