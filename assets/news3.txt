William attack claim, drugs admission and concerns about Camilla detailed in reports on Harry’s new book
Prince Harry has accused his brother of physically attacking him in his new memoir, which reveals a wide range of private conversations between him and other senior British royals and details his split from the family, according to media outlets who said they had obtained early copies of the book.
Perhaps the most dramatic revelation to emerge was the accusation from the Duke of Sussex of an altercation with Prince William during an argument over his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex in 2019, first reported by The Guardian.
That’s just one of a series of grievances and accusations Harry appears to make in the autobiography. Other sensational disclosures include divulging the number of Taliban fighters he killed while serving in Afghanistan, opening up about his final moments with the late Queen Elizabeth II, taking drugs as a teen and speaking to a woman with “powers” about his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.
CNN has not seen a copy of the book but has requested an advance copy of the book from publisher Penguin Random House before its release on January 10. Kensington Palace, Buckingham Palace and a spokesperson for the Sussexes declined CNN’s request for comment on the alleged altercation.
